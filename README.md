From facial recognition for phone unlocking to enabling autonomous vehicles, Computer Vision (CV) is ubiquitous. This project aims to equip you with the perfect starter pack which will help you dive into the realms of CV. 

The project is divided into two phases. The first month will focus on Image processing. Initially, we will cover the basics of Fourier transformation and gradually advance towards understanding spatial-temporal filters, hybridisation of images and multi-scale pyramids. 
The second phase encompasses digital video processing. We'll explore and implement Motion Magnificationâ€”a technique that enhances subtle motions in video sequences, making them more visible to the human eye.
